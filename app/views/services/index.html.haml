    %p You can connect more services to your account:
    #services
      %a.services{:href => "/auth/google"}
        = image_tag "google_64.png", :size => "64x64",  :alt => "Google"
      %a.services{:href => "/auth/twitter"}
        = image_tag "twitter_64.png", :size => "64x64",  :alt => "Twitter"
    %p If you signed-up for CommunityGuides via an authentication service a random password has been set for the local password. You can request a new password using the "Forgot your Password?" link on the sign-in page.
